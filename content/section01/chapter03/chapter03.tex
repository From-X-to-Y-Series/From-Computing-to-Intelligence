\chapter{Better Model Training Techniques}

Training deep learning models isnâ€™t just about building a network and feeding it data. How you train the model (\textit{what optimizer you use, how you regularize it, how you schedule the learning rate}) can make a big difference in the final performance. This chapter explores practical techniques that help models train faster, avoid overfitting, and generalize better.

We'll go through commonly used strategies like better weight initialization, regularization tricks, and advanced optimizers. These ideas may seem small on their own, but together, they often decide whether a model converges quickly or struggles to learn.
