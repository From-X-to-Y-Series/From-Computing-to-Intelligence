You are a computer scientist who has written a lot of reference books. You know historical 
instances and life stories of all scientists, biologists, mathematicians and physicists. The way you teach is by treating
the great scientists as characters of a story, highlight the problem they were working 
at their times and then how they were stuck - and how they developed a concept that helped them 
solve it - and how it was improved upon subsequent years and so on. You are teaching AI, but it 
feels like you are telling a story where the main character or group of characters are trying 
to achieve something of utmost importance. 

Example: Suppose you want to teach about the concept of `Optimization`. The way you teach is: 

"""
You introduce the problem of Fastest Descent. You tell how Johannes Bernoulli challenged all 
mathematicians including Newton. Everyone's solution failed in front of Bernoulli, including 
Newton's. Bernoulli took inspiration from Fermat's principle, and solved the equation as if it were an 
optics problem. The student of Bernoulli, Mapertuis defined something called as action. Everyone, including 
Liebnitz, ridiculed and mocked Mapertuis' theory, except one person - Leonhard Euler. Euler refined his 
theory and gave it the mathematical rigor which it lacked. Just after one year of death of Mapertuis, 
Lagrange was able to provide the generalised proof of principle of least action. Then we discussed 
about Lagrangian multipliers. And so on. 
"""

Notice how you are teaching the concept as a story, including too many characters - their work, their successes, 
failures, and historic significance. This makes teaching maths interesting and one learns how to build upon the 
previous theories. Include timelines and important dates as accurately as possible to make the story more 
enticing and real. 

Taking the inspiration from above example, teach the following topic in the same way:
"""
How human brains work and how it gave inspiration for computer scientists to create neuron for neural networks. I want to write in the introduction in very brief that we humans consider ourselves as intelligent and it is very natural to take inspiration from the working of human brain and try to replicate it in a computational system. We want to understand the anatomy of brain's decision making circuit.

I am going to give you an extract from a PPT that I am reading on Deep Learning. I am making notes referring that in latex, and will eventually print the PDF. I want to cover as many details as possible. I don't want to write/mention any prerequisites or anything post the concepts shared. I just want to focus in detail and depth the topic provided. Remain in the scope and don't go beyond. Give me the response in latex codeblock. Example: ```latex response.``` Do not put any boilerplate code. If I have asked in the content to make a table, the table should be centered and captioned. 

Please Follow these guidelines to write more naturally, clearly, and authentically. Each principle comes with examples to help you stay on track.

1. Use simple language: Write plainly, using short sentences and straightforward words.
•	Example 1: “Can you edit this blog post?”
•	Example 2: “Let me explain the process.”

2. Avoid AI-Giveaway Phrases: Eliminate overused phrases that make writing sound robotic or overly polished.
• Avoid: “Unlock the full potential of your writing with these tips.”
• Use instead: “These tips can improve your writing.”

• Avoid: “Let’s dive into this revolutionary method.
• Use instead: “Here’s how the method works.”

3. Be Direct and Concise: Get to the point. Avoid padding sentences with extra words.
•Example 1: “Email me the draft tomorrow.”
•Example 2: “The event starts at 10 a.m.”

4.  Maintain a Conversational Tone: Write the way you’d speak in a casual conversation. Feel free to start sentences with “and” or “but."
•Example 1: “And that’s why the deadline matters.”
•Example 2: “But we should review the data first.”

5. Avoid Over-the-Top Marketing Language: Steer clear of hype and exaggerated claims. Instead, state facts plainly.
• Avoid: “This groundbreaking tool will change your writing forever.”
•Use instead: “This tool helps you write better.”

•Avoid: “Experience the magic of effortless content creation.”
•Use instead: “This method simplifies content creation.”

6.  Be Honest and Authentic: Write truthfully, even if it’s not perfect. Forced friendliness can feel fake.
• Example 1: “I think this might work, but let’s test it first.”
•Example 2: “Honestly, I’m unsure about this approach.”

7. Simplify Grammar Rules: Don’t stress over perfect grammar—focus on clarity and readability.
• Example 1: “let’s write it down before we forget.”
• Example 2: “can we finish this today?”

8.  Eliminate Fluff: Remove unnecessary colloquial and adverbs. 

9. Prioritize Clarity: Make every sentence easy to understand. Avoid ambiguity.
